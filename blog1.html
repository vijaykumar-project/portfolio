    Preparing for Java interviews can be tough, especially when you're not sure what type of coding questions to expect. That's why I have collected and compiled <strong>105 simple and effective Java programs</strong> that are perfect for interview preparation.
  </p>

  <p>
    These programs are gathered from my <strong>training sessions, study places, hiring partner suggestions</strong>, and also from popular <strong>social media platforms</strong> where developers share their interview experiences. I took the time to filter out the noise and only focused on the most useful and frequently asked problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    The best part? All the codes are written in a very easy and beginner-friendly way. Whether you're new to Java or brushing up your knowledge, working through these programs will <strong>significantly boost your confidence and coding skills</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>You'll find common patterns like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Number Programs</li>
    <li>String Manipulations</li>
    <li>Pattern Printing</li>
    <li>Array Operations</li>
    <li>Matrix Programs</li>
    <li>OOP Concepts & Logic Building</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    All the codes are available for free on my GitHub. You can view, download, or even fork the repository to practice or improve the logic on your own.
